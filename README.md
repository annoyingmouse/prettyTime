prettyTime
==========

A jQuery plugin which converts minutes into test representation, for instance:

* 1 = "one minute",
* 61 = "one hour and one minute".

Built for a specific purpose when I was getting duration from a server in minutes and thought that it'd be nicer to have a proper representation in English of duration.

Some really rather complex maths involved which I'm pretty sure I foraged from the internet. I've not used proper jQuery plugin guidelines but it works anyway - I will perhaps get around to doing it properly, for instance it'd be nice to pass the plugin an object which will style the output.

It's online [here](https://googledrive.com/host/0ByRgQIhodQXfaVdHOElsZTV5c3c/time/). Which is a pretty extensive test...
